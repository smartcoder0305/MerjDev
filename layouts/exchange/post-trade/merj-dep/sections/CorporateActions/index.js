      <p>
      MERJ Dep can generate a variety of reports that allows issuers of securities listed on MERJ Exchange to get a snapshot 
      or a full register of the securities held electronically in a number of formats, such as a list of top registered security 
      holders or a summary of security holders by country. Furthermore, MERJ Dep can provide a Comparison of Movement report that 
      shows the change in shareholdings on a daily, weekly or monthly basis or as may be requested by the issuer. For the provision of its services,
      MERJ Dep enters into an agreement with each issuer whose securities are listed on MERJ Exchange.
