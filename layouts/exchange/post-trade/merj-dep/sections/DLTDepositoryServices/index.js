      <p>
        <strong>
          MERJ Dep plans to roll out the following depository services for DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) Assets in 2019.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
      The MERJ Dep Rules provide that MERJ Dep may accept any “eligible assets” for deposit, which is a 
      pre-requisite for eligibility to listing and transacting on MERJ Exchange and for clearing and settlement by MERJ Clear.
      </p>

      <p>
      Depository services are available for companies where the share register is maintained by a third-party registry service provider (i.e. not MERJ Dep),
      making both Seychelles and global issuers eligible to list their shares and other securities on MERJ Exchange even where we do not maintain the register..
      </p>

      <p>
        Due to the uniquely risky nature of digital assets, 
        MERJ is implementing a robust wallet and security solution with our partners to maintain custody and safekeeping of these assets.
      </p>
