      <p>
      MERJ Dep maintains an electronic securities ownership register of uncertificated securities for securities listed on MERJ Exchange.
      MERJ Dep records all successful transactions of eligible securities executed on MERJ Exchange and cleared through an approved securities facility participant,
      which includes MERJ Clear.  The MERJ Dep electronic register ties in seamlessly with the MERJ Exchange Automated Trading System (ATS) and MERJ Clearâ€™s clearing and settlement system.
      Thus, the securities ownership register is updated on a real-time basis simultaneously with the trade being matched, 
      securities accounts being updated and funds (cash) accounts being updated between the buyer and seller.<br /><br />
      By having the Securities Ownership Register in an electronic format,
      issuers of securities listed on MERJ Exchange benefit from an accurate and real-time updated register of members with no outstanding securities transactions.
