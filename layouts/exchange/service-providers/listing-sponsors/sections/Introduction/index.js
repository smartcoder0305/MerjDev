      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The MERJ listing framework provides for the role of a listing sponsor (Sponsor Advisor).
        Sponsor Advisors are qualified global advisors of issuers of securities (including
        securities tokens) and digital assets. A MERJ approved Sponsor Advisor must be appointed by
        an issuer seeking to apply for a primary listing of securities or digital assets on either
        MERJ Primary or MERJ Exchange.
      </p>

      <p>
        MERJ Sponsor Advisors provide a value-added service to issuers and help maintain the overall
        integrity of MERJ markets. They have a primary obligation to MERJ by ensuring adherence by
        applicants and listed issuers to the prevailing Listing Rules in place at the time. They
        advise issuers on their initial and ongoing obligations as laid out in the Listing Rules.
      </p>

      <p>
        MERJ provides a unique combination of a regulated global primary market platform (MERJ
        Primary) along with a regulated global secondary market (MERJ Exchange) each of which
        support securities (including securities tokens) and digital assets. Issuers range from
        early stage startups through to seasoned companies. As a licensed and regulated national
        securities exchange, securities and other instruments listed on MERJ are considered listed
        securities under Seychelles law and will usually qualify as “listed securities” in terms of
        regulations of foreign markets. This means potentially attracting a broader range of global
        investors and a larger portion of investment mandates both on the primary and secondary
        markets.
