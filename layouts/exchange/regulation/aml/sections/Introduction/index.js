      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        MERJ Exchange and its Members must adhere to applicable law for the prevention of money
        laundering and terrorist financing. MERJ, the Government of Seychelles and our regulators
        (Financial Services Authority and Central Bank of Seychelles) are committed to the
        prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing. Seychelles AML laws and practices
        are in line with standards established by the Financial Action Task Force, a global
        standard setting body for prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing. MERJ group
        companies are “reporting entities” in terms of the Anti-Money Laundering Act.
      </p>
      <h3>Know Your Client (KYC)</h3>
      <p>
        Direct participants of MERJ Exchange, MERJ Clear, MERJ Dep or MERJ Primary must provide
        information and supporting documents, to establish their identity and permanent address.
        Non-individual clients must provide supporting documents, including documents from the
        “beneficial owners”. In each case, the required documents and information are in line with
        the requirements established by the Government of Seychelles and MERJ regulators (Financial
        Services Authority).
      </p>
      <h3>Source of Funds</h3>
      <p>
        Direct participants of MERJ Exchange, MERJ Clear, MERJ Dep or MERJ Primary may be requested
        to provide information and supporting documents to establish the lawful source of any funds
        or assets introduced into the MERJ ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p>
        Upon introduction of digital assets, MERJ Dep plans to use a third-party application to scan
        each proposed wallet to be added by a participant for the purposes of depositing or
        withdrawing digital assets (i.e. cryptocurrencies and utility tokens). MERJ Dep may, 
        at its sole discretion, accept a proposed wallet based on this analysis, as well as any 
        further communication and supporting documentation provided by the participant. The integrity
        of the MERJ ecosystem is of paramount importance to MERJ.
      </p>
      <p>
        For information relating to regulatory activities by MERJ Clear or MERJ Dep (i.e. clearing,
        settlement, depository/registry), please see the "Post Trade" section.
