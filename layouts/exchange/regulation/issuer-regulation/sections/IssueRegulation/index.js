      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>

        Issuers of securities and other instruments listed on any market operated by MERJ must meet the Listing Rules, which prescribe the initial and ongoing
        obligations of the issuer. Beyond meeting the requirements for the initial listing, all issuers are required to maintain the listing in good standing. Key provisions
        for the listings include:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>A requirement to have a trading policy in place</li>
        <li>To report any substantial shareholder transactions to management</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The key provisions aim to mitigate against insider trading along a clear framework that requires full disclosure of “material information” in a timely manner, thus
        ensuring transparency and fairness.
      </p>


      <p>
        Issuers are regulated by the MERJ Regulation Division. Where a Sponsor Advisor has been
        appointed, the Sponsor Advisor also helps to ensure issuers adhere to the prevailing Listing
        Rules.
