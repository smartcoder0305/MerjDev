      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Government of Seychelles and its regulators are committed to maintaining the integrity
        of the jurisdiction. Seychelles legislation (Securities Act 2007, National Payment Systems
        Act 2014 and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2006) is in line with prevailing international norms
        and meets minimum requirements laid down by global standard setting bodies such as the
        Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
        (OECD). As such, Seychelles is in good standing with these standard-setting bodies and has
        never been on a published 'blacklist' by any of these bodies.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Seychelles Securities Act 2007 and National Payment Systems Act 2014, along with
        subsequent regulations, provides a clearly defined legal framework in line with international
        best practices to underpin regulation of MERJ Exchange markets. The MERJ rules framework
        builds upon this legal framework and provide a simplified and clearly defined framework
        using industry best practice principles. MERJ operates within an orderly and transparent
        market structure designed to instill confidence to our listed issuers, Members, participants
        and the investment community.
